# It is divided into three sections: folders excluded, extensions excluded and files excluded
# (in thos files sections must be written in that order!)
# Sections start with: 
#  "- fo" (or "- folders excluded"): it is the beginning of the list of excluded folders
#  "- ex" (or "- extensions excluded"): it is the beginning of the list of excluded extensions
#  "- fi" (or "- files excluded"): it is the beginning of the list of excluded files

# pound sign is the comment symbol. All text in a line following a # sign will be ignored 
# an example follows, well suited for the folders in ITT's Blaise Pascal - Cesena LAN server
